Design Process
--------------
As mentioned before, the website was constructed with the company's luxurious asthetic integrated into its design elements, while also keeping things minimalistic. The website's NAV bar is very visible and navigation around the site is straightfoward with a simple button design. 
The "Home" page is the website's landing page.
The "Gallery" page is where the company showcases their newly constructed furniture for sale.
The "Customization" page is where clients can view customization options should they want to personally customize their furniture.
The "Reservation" page is where clients and potential clients can book a reservation with a professional consultant from the company.

Features
--------
The NAV bar is on every page of the website which allows uers to navigate from page to page easily. Clicking on the pages' respective titles on the NAV bar also brings them to that specific page. The footer of the website displays the companys physical store locations, their respective phone numbers, and company's main avenue of contact (email).

The pictures of furniture in the landing page of the website are interactive, when clicked, they bring the user to the gallery page of the website, allowing the user to view the pictures of the furniture more clearly.
The landing page provides a breif description of the company and shows pictures of their previous work, which is all an interested customer really needs, this keeps the page clean and not convoluted.

The gallery page displays and categorises different pieces of furniture the company currenltly has for sale. 

The customization page offers different customization options for the different types of furniture and gives a breif description on the varying materials.

The reserve page is for a potential client to be able to book a professionial consultant - to that end, the website has a form, which takes in user input and processes them via javascript. The function in javascript is called upon and runs when the "Submit" button is clicked. The form takes in the name, phone number, pax, and the client's desired date and timeslot. When the client's information is successfully logged, an alert box will pop up displaying a "Reservation Successful" message, which the client can proceed to close by presssing the "Ok" button. After inputting the information, the javascript creates an object that will store the customer and reservation information. 

Testing
-------
1) Testing reserve form
i) Filling in information fields.
ii) Inputting information via "Submit" button.
iii) Checking if the console logged the object correctly.
